My solution for a competition

### Problem statement
The problem is related to finance. After conducting several exploratories on the given dataset, we concluded that this might be a problem related to detecting fraud in finance.

### Including:
- Data preparation
- Training using several tree-based models 

### Approach
Our approach to the problem was to increase the recall rate in class 1 as high as possible so that it can block as much as fraud. Meanwhile, the precision in class 0 should also be high so that the cost for double-check process conducted be human will be lower.
However, accuracy and F-score should always be considered.

### Future improvements
